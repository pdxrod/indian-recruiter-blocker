Hi
Please share your resume if you are interested in the below role

UI Tech Lead || fully remote

Long term contract


This person is 60% hands on development and 40% leadership/mentoring others so they need to be very high level. Focus is on the front end with React and Javascript.


Candidates need to be 60-70% hands-on development, 30-40% mentoring/leadership. Over time that might change as the teams are built up. All need strong engineering fundamentals and ability to define and uphold development best practices

Don't really have anyone strong in the UI space right now. Ideally would want someone with a little API experience but fully UI is okay.

Requirements:

Javascript
React.js
Redux
HTML5
CSS3
UI testing experience/frameworks: Jest, Jasmine, Karma, etc. Not just running a test but need to understand testing strategy, test pyramids. Unit, integration, regression testing.
Experience working on modern progressive web applications

Apply for this job
Hi

My name is Rod. 

This is a description of how the Indian recruiter blocker works.
If an email contains phrases like
"I am reaching out to you on an exciting job opportunity with one such direct client."
"Please find the below requirement details." 
etc.
and appears to be from a guy with an Indian name like Kumar, it's probably
irrelevant recruiter spam, caused by "carpet-bombing" all the emails this recruiter
has with all the jobs he might have.

Thanks and Regards,
 
Rod

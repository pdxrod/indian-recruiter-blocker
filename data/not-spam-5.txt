I hope my email finds you well.

With every humility and respect I do believe there is a need to trust someone like you in times like this and beyond.
My name is Ms.Laura F.Cantrelli, a banker based in United Kingdom, I
have previously sent you an email regarding a transaction of
US$4,802,650.00 left behind by my late client before he was
assassinated alongside his family and was later confirmed as a
mistaken identity but no response from you.

However, I am contacting you once again with a strong belief that you
will work /partner with me to execute this business transaction in
good faith.

On your show of interest I will proceed in presenting you to the bank as the next of kin,
your swift response will be motivating, provide your information.

As a matter of fact, this transaction is 100% guaranteed and risk
free. I look forward to your acknowledgement.

Best Regard

Ms.Laura F.Cantrelli
